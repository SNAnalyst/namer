# namer

The goal of namer is to name the chunks of R Markdown files. It's your safety net when you've (willingly) forgotten to name most chunks of all R Markdown files in a folder.

For context about _why_ you should name your R Markdown chunks, read [this blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2017/08/08/chunkpets/).
